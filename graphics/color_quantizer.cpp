// bit at a time, starting at the most significant bit. These three bits form

//
// This means that adjacent leaves in the tree will represent colors that are
// close together. Once the tree has more leaves than we want, we take all
// leaves under one node, combine them, and make their parent a new leaf with
// their average color. The old leaves are then discarded.
//
// The depth of the tree is the number of bits we look at. Technically this
